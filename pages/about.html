„Cool, a DEX!“. index.ow will not be a decentralized exchange, commonly called DEX, it is an index of all OpenWeb smart contract calls.<br>
<br>
You will be able to:<br>
<ul>
<li>Sort the results</li>
<li>Group by:
<ul>    <li>Date: like a Blockexplorer (default)</li>
    <li>Domain: see the history of each domain</li>
    <li>Owner: who owns which domain?</li>
    <li>Method: get a history of each methods </li></ul>
</li>
<li> Search by method, domain or owner</li>
</ul>
<br>

The data is pre-generated and stored decentralized on the OW Network. A direct connection via web3 will be implemented in a next bigger release. The data will be updated maximum every day and minimum 12hours* after new smart contract call (some calls will be excluded to protect loop calls).<br>
*12hours: at the moment every step (update data, create js-files, upload git, hash, smart contract call) has to be done manually, the update time will probably take longer at the beginning.

search.ow is a decentralized search engine for ow domains. Well, the data for the (local browser based) search engine is stored decentralized, but the index for the data has to be updated manually. This shouldn’t be a problem for openweb.network, as OW Domains aren’t updated that much and are always static files. <br>
Only OW domains will be indexed, external links to the centralized web will not be indexed! <br>
We accept robots.txt files and only follow links like other search engines.<br>
<br>
Our database got all OW domains with published data!

                    <p>It is common to use CDN services for website development. CDN is short for content delivery network. As OpenWeb hosts content decentralized, our version of CDN is a DCDN. To avoid websiteFilesLimit problems, you can link to our DCDN versions of angular, bootstrap etc. <br>
At the moment only files used by our own projects are available. Please feel free to contact us, if you would like to add some files.</p>
